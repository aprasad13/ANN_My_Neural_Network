# My_Neural_Network
In this project, I have build a <strong>Deep Neural Network</strong>, with as many layers as we want!

- In this project, I have implemented all the functions required to build a deep neural network.
- I have used these functions to build a deep neural network for image classification (cat/non-cat)

**Note:**
- I have implemented an easy-to-use neural network class.
- I have used non-linear units like ReLU for the hidden layers to improve your model and Sigmoid function for outer layer.
- I have build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer). We can mention the number of hidden layers and their corresponding number of nodes we want in our neural network.


## Performance
I have compared the performance of a 2 Layer neural network vs L-layer neural network (4 Layer) to classify a cat and non-cat image on the test data

- 2 Layer had accuracy of 72%
- 4 Layer had accuracy of 80%

So, neural network with more than 2 layers performed better
